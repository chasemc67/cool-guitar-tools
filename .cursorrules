Cool Guitar Tools is a directory of guitar and music resources

It's built with:
- React
- Remix
- Tailwind
- ShadCN
- Postgres/Supabase 

And we also use:
- Vercel (for deployment and some analytics)
- Posthog (for feedback, and advanced analytics)
- Supabase (for data)
- BuyMeACoffee (for accepting tips)

We always add storybook stories to all our UI components.
We always add Jest unit tests to all our util files.

When adding new React components, we give each their own folder, with a story and index.tsx to export them. The structure looks like this:

ðŸ“‚ ReactComponentName/
â”œâ”€â”€ ReactComponentName.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ ReactComponentName.stories.tsx
â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
